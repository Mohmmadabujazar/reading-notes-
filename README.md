 # fix your weaknees >>>
1. Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning: When you make a mistake or fall short of a goal, you haven’t failed; you’ve learned. Instead of regretting a failure, study it for strategies to win in the future.

2. Stop seeking approval: When you prioritize approval over learning, you sacrifice your own potential for growth. Do something well at work and don’t tell anyone. Let the recognition come to you.

3. Value the process over the end result: Intelligent people enjoy the learning process, and don’t mind when it continues beyond an expected time frame. I returned to school and got my MBA at the age of 52 so that I could teach at a university
